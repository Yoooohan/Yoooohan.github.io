Greetings! Thank you for visiting my page!
I am Yuhan and I received my PhD from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China [(UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2021, and currently I am a research associate at the [Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR)](http://english.aircas.cn/) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China. I mainly work on the image processing, especially in infrared target detection. Additionally, I also work on the remote sensing image processing.
